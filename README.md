# Challenge

Build a new project that needs to retrieve some data and show to customers:
Build a .NET API which should retrieve data from: 

- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 

Create endpoints to show this data which should contain some input filters (you can decide which filters are good for each one); 

Optional - Build a frontend in any technology to display the content. No need to put much effort on styling or validations, the idea is to show if you're capable of to tackle simple frontend task and display data from an API.
